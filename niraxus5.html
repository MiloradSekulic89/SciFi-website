          The scene shifted to the ship's kitchen, where a group of 14 marines were gathered around a large table. The room was dimly lit, with a few flickering fluorescent lights overhead. The walls were lined with cabinets and countertops, and a large refrigerator hummed in the corner. On the main table, there were drinks and snacks scattered about, and the air was thick with the scent of coffee and tobacco.
          
          Sgt. Michael Taylor, a tall man with a thick beard, sat at the head of the table, smoking a Cuban cigar. He was the leader of the marine unit on board the ship, and commanded the respect of his men. The marines were all dressed in their standard issue jumpsuits, and they were all armed with standard issue sidearms.
          
          The marines were engaged in a long game of poker, and the stakes were high. They were playing with "star credits," a form of currency used by the ship's crew for various transactions. The game had been going on for hours, and the players were deep in concentration.
          
          "I've got a pair of eights," said Private Jenkins, a young man with a buzz cut. His speech was slurred and his movements were slow and unsteady, clearly drunk.
          
          "I'm all in," said Corporal Rodriguez, a Hispanic woman, pushing her stack of star credits forward.
          
          "I'm out," said Private Lee, a Korean-American soldier, throwing his cards down in frustration.
          
          "So, how much you got left, Jenkins?" asked Sgt. Taylor, blowing smoke from his cigar.
          
          "Not much, just enough to keep me in the game," replied Private Jenkins, his eyes focused on Private Lee. "But I got a feeling Lee here's been cheating. I ain't no sucker, I know when someone's trying to pull one over on me."
          
          Private Lee's face turned red with anger. "What the hell are you talking about? I ain't no cheater!"
          
          "You're a damn liar is what you are!" Jenkins slurred, standing up from the table and leaning towards Private Lee.
          
          "Sit down, Jenkins," Sgt. Taylor ordered, but Jenkins was too drunk to listen.
          
          "You're a thief, Lee! You're stealing from us, and I ain't gonna stand for it!" Jenkins shouted, and before anyone could react, he swung his fist and hit Lee in the face.
          
          The other marines jumped up from their seats, some cheering, others laughing.
          
          "Fight! Fight! Fight!" they shouted, egging the two men on.
          
          Jenkins pulled out his sidearm and pointed it at Lee. "I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!"
          
          Sgt. Taylor acted quickly, jumping up and punching Jenkins in the nose, breaking it. He then grabbed Jenkins' sidearm and pointed it at the ground.
          
          "Alright, that's enough!" he shouted, his voice echoing through the room. "Jenkins, you're under arrest. The rest of you, stand down. Doc, get down here and take Jenkins to the medical bay. He's in no condition to be holding a weapon."

          The doctor rushed in and administered first aid to Jenkins, then took him away to the medical bay for further treatment.
          
          Sgt. Taylor then ordered the remaining marines to return to their quarters and get some rest. The game of poker was forgotten, and the only thing left was the bitter taste of violence and betrayal.
          
          "What the hell was that all about?" Corporal Rodriguez asked, looking at the blood on the floor.
          
          "Just another day on this damn ship," Sgt. Taylor replied, shaking his head. "Go get some sleep, all of you. We've got a long journey ahead of us."
          
          The marines filed out of the room, leaving Sgt. Taylor alone with his thoughts. He couldn't shake the feeling that this was just the beginning of something much worse to come.
